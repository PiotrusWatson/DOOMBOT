# DOOMBOT
A BOT THAT PLAYS DOOM

!IMPORTANT! THIS STUFF KINDA WORKS SO PLS BRANCH OFF WHEN MAKING SCARY CHANGES THAT MIGHT BREAK IT THANKS


CURRENT STATE OF MY BOYO DOOMBOT:
A BOT THAT TURNS TOWARDS A SECOND PLAYER (LOAD 2 IN) AND RUNS TOWARDS IT WHILE SHOOTING (RANDOMLY)

	WE HAVE CLASSES:
		PLAYER CONTAINS:
			METHODS THAT ALLOW PLAYERS TO MOVE TO THINGS, TURN TO THINGS AND DO FUN STUFF
			WRAPPERS FOR CALLS FOR RELATIVE MOVEMENT FORWARDS, STRAFING AND TURNING
			AND SHOOTING LOL
		
		BOT_MAIN JUST:
			HAS OUR MAIN INFINITE GAME LOOP - ONLY THE AMOUNT WE SLEEP SHOULD BE CHANGED HERE
		
		GAME_STATE HAS:
			AN UPDATE FUNCTION CONTAINING ALL THE ACTIONS/POST REQUESTS WE WANT TO DO IN ONE ITERATION
			A POLL FUNCTION CONTAINING ALL THE STUFF WE WANNA FIND OUT IN ONE ITERATION
			(ALSO GRABS AND STORES WHETHER WE ARE THE PLAYER OR NOT IN THE CONSTRUCTOR)
			!NOTE: THE GET ALL FUNCTION GETS ALL PLAYERS INCLUDING OUR DATA, BUT WE CHECK AGAINST THAT HERE!
		SESSION CONTAINS:
			WRAPPERS OF THE ACTUAL STRAIGHT UP API CALLS - WE STILL NEED TO IMPLEMENT THE GET REQUEST FOR ALL 
			OTHER ITEMS THAT AREN'T PLAYERS
